## About
This repository contains solutions for four assignments regarding Data Structures and Algorithms for The Odin Project curriculum. This application is Javascript-only and does not have a front-end; rather, it uses the browser's developer console.

## Features

### Fibonacci and Mergesort Assignment
- [fib.js](https://github.com/RyanNDao/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/fib.js) contains two Fibonacci functions that return an array of the first n Fibonacci numbers. One function is implemented via loops and another via recursion
- [mergesort.js](https://github.com/RyanNDao/data-structures-and-algorithms/blob/main/mergesort.js) contains a function, `mergesort`, that takes in an array and recursively sorts the elements using merge sort
